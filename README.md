## Overview
This is my first time trying a Frontend Mentor challenge. I chose the blog preview card design because it's simple and well designed. I liked the visual layout and wanted to test my skills with it. Although it's a small component, it covers many core ideas and has been a great opportunity to get familiar with my development workflow.

### The challenge
-Make a pixel perfect card.
-Users should be able to See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I used only vanilla HTML-CSS for this project. I began by setting up a basic design system with custom properties for colors, typography, and spacing. After that, I created utility classes to speed up styling. Then I moved on to the HTML markup, structured the layout, and started applying my utility classes. Finally, I refined the design by replacing fixed font sizes and widths with a more fluid, responsive approach using clamp().

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Custom utility classes

### What I learned

## Acknowledgments
I used the clamp font size generator tool, it helped me figure out the grow factor for the font sizes without having to guess random vw values. I definitely recommend it to anyone starting out who wants to get the hang of fluid typography without overcomplicating things.
